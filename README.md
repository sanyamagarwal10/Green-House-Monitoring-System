# 🌿Green-House-Monitoring-System

𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻

The Greenhouse Monitoring System project presents a smart and automated solution for monitoring environmental conditions within a greenhouse. This system uses Arduino to measure critical factors such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, ensuring optimal conditions for plant growth. By simulating the system in Proteus 8 Professional, users can easily design and test the system in a virtual environment before deployment. 🌱

This project is ideal for IoT, automation, and smart farming applications, helping farmers and gardening enthusiasts monitor their greenhouse remotely with minimal effort.

# Key Features:
𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗹-𝗧𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴: Continuously monitors temperature, humidity, and soil moisture levels to ensure optimal greenhouse conditions.

𝗦𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗼𝗿-𝗕𝗮𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Uses DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity, and a Soil Moisture Sensor for real-time soil data.

𝗔𝗹𝗲𝗿𝘁𝘀: Configurable to trigger alerts when environmental conditions go beyond safe thresholds.

𝗨𝘀𝗲𝗿-𝗙𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗹𝘆 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗮𝗰𝗲: Easy-to-read data display on LCD for real-time feedback.

𝗦𝗶𝗺𝘂𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻-𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗱𝘆: Fully simulated in Proteus 8 Professional, making it easy to visualize and test the system before actual deployment.

 # Technologies Used:
• Hardware: Arduino Uno, DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, soil moisture sensor, relays for control.

• Software: Arduino IDE for programming the Arduino Uno, Proteus 8 Professional for circuit simulation and testing.

• Communication Protocols: Used serial communication for data transfer between sensors and the Arduino.
