# 🌿Green-House-Monitoring-System

𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻

The Greenhouse Monitoring System project presents a smart and automated solution for monitoring environmental conditions within a greenhouse. This system uses Arduino to measure critical factors such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, ensuring optimal conditions for plant growth. By simulating the system in Proteus 8 Professional, users can easily design and test the system in a virtual environment before deployment. 🌱

This project is ideal for IoT, automation, and smart farming applications, helping farmers and gardening enthusiasts monitor their greenhouse remotely with minimal effort.

# Key Features:
• Real-Time Monitoring: Implemented sensors to continuously monitor key environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.

• Automated Control: Designed systems to automate irrigation and ventilation based on sensor data.

• Simulation and Testing: Used PSpice for circuit simulation to ensure reliable sensor integration and system stability.

• User Interface: Created a basic interface for users to view real-time data and control system settings.

 # Technologies Used:
• Hardware: Arduino Uno, DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, soil moisture sensor, relays for control.

• Software: Arduino IDE for programming the Arduino Uno, Proteus 8 Professional for circuit simulation and testing.

• Communication Protocols: Used serial communication for data transfer between sensors and the Arduino.
