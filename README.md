# Green-House-Monitoring-System
Developed a Greenhouse Monitoring System using Arduino Uno and Proteus 8 Professional to ensure optimal growing conditions for plants.
This project combined hardware and simulation tools to create a robust system for real-time environmental monitoring and control.

# Key Features:
•Real-Time Monitoring: Implemented sensors to continuously monitor key environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.

•Automated Control: Designed systems to automate irrigation and ventilation based on sensor data.

•Simulation and Testing: Used PSpice for circuit simulation to ensure reliable sensor integration and system stability.

•User Interface: Created a basic interface for users to view real-time data and control system settings.

 # Technologies Used:
•Hardware: Arduino Uno, DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, soil moisture sensor, relays for control.

•Software: Arduino IDE for programming the Arduino Uno, Proteus 8 Professional for circuit simulation and testing.

•Communication Protocols: Used serial communication for data transfer between sensors and the Arduino.
