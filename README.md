# Green-House-Monitoring-System
Developed a Greenhouse Monitoring System using Arduino Uno and PSpice to ensure optimal growing conditions for plants.
This project combined hardware and simulation tools to create a robust system for real-time environmental monitoring and control.

# Key Features:
~Real-Time Monitoring: Implemented sensors to continuously monitor key environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.
~Automated Control: Designed systems to automate irrigation and ventilation based on sensor data.
~Simulation and Testing: Used PSpice for circuit simulation to ensure reliable sensor integration and system stability.
~User Interface: Created a basic interface for users to view real-time data and control system settings.

 # Technologies Used:
~Hardware: Arduino Uno, DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, soil moisture sensor, relays for control.
~Software: Arduino IDE for programming the Arduino Uno, PSpice for circuit simulation and testing.
~Communication Protocols: Used serial communication for data transfer between sensors and the Arduino.
